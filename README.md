# Introduction
This repository contains the source code for a decentralized application (Dapp) that has been built using Solidity, deployed on the Goerli test network, and utilizing Hardhat for deployment, Ethers.js for connecting with the front end, Metamask for transactions, and React.js for the front end. All transaction data are stored in the Goerli Test Network.

### Solidity
[Solidity](https://soliditylang.org) is a high-level programming language that is used to write smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain. In this dApp, Solidity is used to write the smart contract that governs the transaction and manipulation of data within the application.
**Check [here](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) for more details.**

### Goerli Test Network
[Goerli Test Network](https://goerli.net) is a public, proof-of-stake Ethereum test network that has been used for testing and deployment of this dApp. This allows for a safe and secure environment for experimentation and iteration before deploying to a main network.

### Hardhat
[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org) is a development environment that has been utilized to deploy the smart contract in this dApp. It provides features such as automated contract testing, network management, and more, making it a valuable tool for dApp development.

### Ethers.js
[Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) is a library that has been used to connect the front end of the dApp to the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a convenient and user-friendly interface for interacting with the smart contract and performing transactions.

### Metamask
[Metamask](https://metamask.io) is a browser extension that has been used to perform transactions within the dApp. It provides a secure and user-friendly interface for managing Ethereum accounts and performing transactions.

### React.js
[React.js](https://es.reactjs.org) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces and has been used for the front end of this dApp. It provides a component-based architecture for building scalable and efficient applications.

# Conclusion
In this project, you have gained a wealth of knowledge and experience in the development of decentralized applications (dApps) using a variety of tools, including Solidity, the Goerli test network, Hardhat, Ethers.js, Metamask, and React.js. By using these tools, you have created a secure and transparent dApp that is able to manage transactions and store all transaction data on the Goerli test network.

With the use of Solidity, you have learned how to write a smart contract to manage transactions and manipulate data within the dApp. The Goerli test network provided a safe environment for testing and deployment, while Hardhat made the deployment process simple and streamlined.

By utilizing Ethers.js, you have gained the skills to connect the front end of the dApp to the Ethereum blockchain and perform transactions using Metamask. The use of React.js allowed you to create a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.

Overall, this project has provided you with a comprehensive understanding of the technologies and techniques involved in dApp development. The knowledge and experience gained from this project will be invaluable in any future dApp projects you may undertake.
